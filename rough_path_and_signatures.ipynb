However, in real life we cannot observe a full continuous path, we can only expect to observe a stream of data that consists of a sampling of the path we are interested in. In financial securities, for instance, the market only shows the prices of the securities at specific times. Therefore, in order to apply techniques from rough path theory to financial securities, we need to define what we mean by the signature of a stream of data.\n",

        "In this article, we have introduced the signature of a continuous path, as well as the signature of a stream of data. As we will see in the following articles, this object will prove to have very interesting applications to machine learning and time series analysis. After showing how to apply signatures to these fields, we will analyse concrete examples of how to use signatures in quantitative finance.\n",
